In this project the dataset of white wine and its certain properties (features: alcohol etc.) was used to train different models. With this we saw difference performance metrics for each model trained to help us decide what model(s) are the best. In the end Extra Trees Classifier had the best performance metrics, doing the best for each one except AUC which the Logistic Regression performed the best. This indicates that the ETC is best model to train and use.
